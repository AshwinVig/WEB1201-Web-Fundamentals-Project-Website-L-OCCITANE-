            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h5>Our Journey <span> In Provence </span></h5>
            <p>It all started at the Provence marketplaces in 1976. A 23-year-old named Olivier Baussan started distilling rosemary essential oil to sell locally with nothing more than an alembic, a tiny truck, and excellent plant knowledge. In order to provide natural beauty to homes around the world, he expanded his production from oils to soaps and creams. He did this by drawing inspiration from the land he grew up on.</p>

            <h1>Commitments</h1>
            <h5>Creating Values <span> Touching Lives </span></h5>
            <p>Our effort to give back is made possible by the L'OCCITANE Foundation, which was established in 2006. Our two main programmes help people with vision impairment all across the world and empower women economically in Burkina Faso. Additionally, our staff members take part in Foundation projects, which range from natural heritage in Provence to post-tsunami restoration in Japan.</p>
